# Searching-Ambulance
In the testcase.zip file you can find the map of a city where #s are obstacles, Ps are patients, A is the ambulance, and numbers are hospitals showing their capacity. The ambulance should move behind a patient to reach the nearest hospital. In the shortest time, the ambulance should take all Ps to hospitals.

I used BFS(Breadth-first search), IDS(Iterative deepening depth-first search), A Star with Manhattan heuristic function, and A Star with the number of remaining patients heuristic function. 

Also I  implement an improvement to the algorithm by adding states with priority at first. The codes have -priority suffix.
